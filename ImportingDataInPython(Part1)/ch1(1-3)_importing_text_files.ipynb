    "IPython, which is running on DataCamp's servers, has a bunch of cool commands, including its [**magic commands**](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html). For example, starting a line with **!** gives you complete system shell access. This means that the IPython magic command **! ls** will display the contents of your current directory. Your task is to use the IPython magic command **! ls** to check out the contents of your current directory and answer the following question: which of the following files is in your working directory?"
