    "# Processing large amounts of Twitter data\n",
    "Sometimes, the data we have to process reaches a size that is too much for a computer's memory to handle. This is a common problem faced by data scientists. A solution to this is to process an entire data source chunk by chunk, instead of a single go all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will do just that. You will process a large csv file of Twitter data in the same way that you processed 'tweets.csv' in Bringing it all together exercises of the prequel course, but this time, working on it in chunks of 10 entries at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in learning how to access Twitter data so you can work with it on your own system, refer to Part 2 of the DataCamp course on Importing Data in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas package has been imported as pd and the file 'tweets.csv' is in your current directory for your use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that this is real data from Twitter and as such there is always a risk that it may contain profanity or other offensive content (in this exercise, and any following exercises that also use real Twitter data)."
